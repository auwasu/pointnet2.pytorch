### note that in order to run the project without error, we need to only modify  
### the files in train_files.txt and test_files.txt to be base file name(without parent dir as prefix), e.g., like below: 
```bash
ply_data_train0.h5
ply_data_train1.h5
ply_data_train2.h5
ply_data_train3.h5
ply_data_train4.h5
```
